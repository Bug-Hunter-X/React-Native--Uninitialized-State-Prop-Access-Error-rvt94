# React Native: Uninitialized State/Prop Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations or when state updates haven't fully propagated.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, showcasing how accessing `this.state.data.someProperty` before the data is fetched from the API leads to an error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using conditional rendering and optional chaining to safely handle the potential `undefined` values.  This ensures a smooth user experience by preventing the application from crashing.
