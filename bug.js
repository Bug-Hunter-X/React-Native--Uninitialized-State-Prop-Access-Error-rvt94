This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  This is common in asynchronous operations where the data might not be available immediately. For example, if you fetch data from an API in `componentDidMount` and try to use that data in the `render` method before the fetch is complete, you will encounter this error.  Another case is when you're using state values in a conditional statement within the render function and the state value is undefined.

```javascript
// Buggy component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error: Can't access property of undefined */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
